# SnapShot-Server

A simple image gallery app.

### Description
SnapShot is built with a MERN (Mongodb, Express, React, Redux, and NodeJS) JavaScript Stack. This is a simple app where you can create albums and to orignize your images. I am working on this project to practice writing code and to learn new skills.

## Getting Started
Our app uses NodeJS packages, all dependencies are listed in our package.json so you'll need to install them if you want to run our Mongo database and our express servers. You must have an up-to-date NodeJS to install our dependencies, which you can find at their site https://nodejs.org/en/download/.     

Run

    npm i

then

    npm start

View the accompanying front-end server repo [here](https://github.com/stephaniesmith/SnapShot-App)

Or visit the live site [here](https://snapshot-image-gallery.herokuapp.com/)

## Built With

    React, Redux, MongoDb, Express, NodeJS, Webpack, Mongoose

## Testing

### TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (TDD)
The process for creating this app was done using the development technique of Test-Driven-Development. For both Front-end and Back-end sides of this app used Test-Driven-Development when testing our routes and models, as well as our reducers and actions for our front-end. This is done to ensure our connections to our database and Redux are functioning before continuing on with futher development, this practice is done to avoid app breaking bugs later on.

To run the tests, in your terminal run:

`npm run test`

## Deployment
This is app is live running on heroku servers https://snapshot-image-gallery.herokuapp.com/
